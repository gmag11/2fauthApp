# 2FAuth Flutter Client

A mobile client application for managing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, designed to work with the [2FAuth web application](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth). This Flutter-based client provides a native mobile experience while securely synchronizing with your self-hosted 2FAuth instance.

## Purpose

This project complements the official 2FAuth web application by offering:

- Native mobile experience for accessing your 2FA codes on the go
- Secure local generation of TOTP/HOTP codes
- Synchronization with your self-hosted 2FAuth server
- Offline access to your authentication codes

**Important**: This client requires a running instance of 2FAuth. It does not replace the web application but extends its functionality to mobile devices.

## Features

- **Secure Code Generation**: All codes are generated locally on your device
- **Server Synchronization**: Sync your accounts and icons from your 2FAuth instance
- **Offline Access**: Access your codes even without internet connection
- **Encrypted Storage**: Your secrets are stored securely using platform encryption
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Runs on Android, iOS, and Windows
- **Real-time Updates**: Codes refresh automatically every 30 seconds
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-tap copying of generated codes
- **Group Organization**: Browse accounts organized by groups
- **Icon Support**: Display service icons for easy identification

## Requirements

### For End Users
